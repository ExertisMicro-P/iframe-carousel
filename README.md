# iframe-carousel
Iframe Carousel for Wall Displays / Monitoring

Simply add URLs into the `sites` or `repeatingsites` arrays.
An iframe will be created for each and will cycle through them using a Bootstrap 3 Carousel.
As the Carousel cycles, each iframe is refreshed to grab the latest content.
A logo and the current time is displayed in a Bootstrap 3 Navbar.
Optionally, the Navbar can show the current URL.
Captions showing the URL can be switched on or off.
